# Interactive Webpage

Implementing JS into a webpage to make it more interactive, as well as using multiple stylesheets for different themes.

# Requirements
- Default HTML sheet
- 4 stylesheets: default, professional, accessible, 'funky'
- Must be able to switch between styles
- 5 seconds after loading page, a popup must appear asking for email to subscribe to the site
- Every 20 seconds the images on the page change
- Send an email using a form to asi4nguy123@gmail.com
- Alert boxes when data is inputted incorrectly
- Count the number of times a link is pressed

# What I Learnt

- The importance and meaning of colours and how colour theory is a key part of web design
  - I learnt about the useful colour palette website https://coolors.co/ which generates palettes based on requirements
- JS syntax and writing imperatively using procedures and functions
- Editing properties of HTML tags using JS
- How to create a professional popup, with input box alerts
- Using form data and a mailto link to create a ready to send email

# Improvements

Device responsivity - with icons and swipe sidebar for mobile devices.\
Add an in-website contact form, rather than using a mailto link.\
==> would need to use a backend language or framework e.g. PHP\
==> requires to be hosted on a server with a site email included in plan to function
